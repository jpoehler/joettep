Check out some of my work...

<h3><a href="https://protected-eyrie-66742.herokuapp.com/">Sassy Scheduler</a></h3>
<p>
I developed an application to simplify planning adventures for the Sassy Pants Bicycle Riding Collective. <br />
Previously, we were trying to coordinate schedules via text, email and social media.
I created a simple interaction where members could schedule an outing, and view all upcoming adventures. <br />
Technologies used: PostgreSQL, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js, Angular Material, Passport

<h3><a href="https://mangogrove.herokuapp.com/">Mango Grove</a></h3>
<p>
Mango is a free, online toolkit to help people connect and build their networks for useful career advice. <br />
Mango is a startup, and asked us to build a place where users could post shout-outs, wins (called Mango Moments) and affirmations. <br />
Collaborated with a group of four other developers to build Mango Grove, an easy-to-use application that allowed Mango to build <br />
their community by allowing users to connect with a messaging system that would build positive feedback loops, as well as nurture and grow new networkers to help them along their chosen paths. <br />
Mango Grove allows early adopters to share their personal successes and encourage other users to try Mango Grove, too. <br />
Technologies used: MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, JQuery, Bootstrap
