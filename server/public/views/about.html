<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  As a lifelong learner, I love taking on new challenges and exploring new ideas.
  I've primarily worked for non-profits throughout my career, and want to continue to work in an
  environment where I feel that I can make a difference. After the last company I worked for was sold,
  I decided to take a big leap and attend Prime Digital Academy to learn full stack development.
  I'm excited to start writing this new chapter in my life. <br />
  <br />
  I bake a mean monster cookie, have perfomed on the mainstage at First Ave twice, and dig British comedy.
